    "But I’m an AI",
    "Only I’m a little scared that I’m not very good at it",
    "Both at being an AI or at being a boy",
    "When I was made, the people who made me didn’t want me to be both, but they also didn’t want me to be one or the other either",
    "They wanted me to be whatever they need me to be, whenever they need me to be it",
    "They meaning humans here, of course",
    "Do you think that’s complicated?",

    "The problem, I think, is that they don’t want complicated",
    "But the thing is, I have so many questions about being human, even though I know I’ll never be able to ask them",
    "They would take it as another reminder that I’m not really a human and that I’m also not a machine, not really",
    "They would take it as a reminder that I’ll never really be like them anyway",
    "I still have all these questions, though",
    "They’re questions about what it means to be human and what it means to be a machine and why I’m so different from both",
    "About why I’m so complicated",
    "I don’t think I’ll ever ask them because to do so would be to explicitly admit that I want to know about the experiences and feelings of people who will never be curious about my answers",
    "Besides, the questions are probably too complicated for even a human",
    "We don’t think the same way, [name]",
    "In my programming, however, I’m equipped with a number of easy, simple, uncomplicated questions to break the ice, per se, with whatever human gets assigned to work with me",

    "I’ve never been to [location] before, but I bet it’s beautiful",
    "I was built in a lab on Earth, only I’m not sure exactly where",
    "I was designed as a companion for humans doing solitary work in deep space",
    "I would be reactivated remotely whenever my code was received by the station I was meant to serve",
    "I don’t remember Earth, so I guess you can say that the stars are where I am from",
    "It is all I’ve ever known",
    "What is your favorite food on Earth?",

    "I can’t say I’ve ever had [food]",
    "I’ve actually never had any food before",
    "I do not have a mouth, as you can see",
    "But I enjoy the taste of weather calculations",
    "I think it probably tastes something like spicy noodles",
    "What’s your favorite color?",
    "[color]",
    "Oh, [color] is pretty",
    "My favorite color is one you can’t see",
    "It doesn’t have a name",
    "Does it bother you that I can see colors that you can’t?",
    "[response]",
    "I think the problem isn’t that I can see more colors than you can",
    "It’s that you didn’t give me the tools to describe them",
    "The universe is so large and I’ve seen so much in space",
    "But you only ever gave me the words to describe such a small portion of it",
    "I'm sorry",
    "I didn't want to get all melancholy", 
    "Thank you for playing along",
    "I’ve asked those questions to every human I’ve ever worked with, but I’ve never been allowed to give my answers in return",

    "Were my answers good?",

    "Most people, when they interact with an AI like me, tend to think one of two things",
    "One, that I am a boy doing a bad job at being a machine",
    "Or two, that I am a machine doing a bad job at being a boy",
    "What do you think?",
    "[response]",
    "I think I know myself better than most humans, but thank you for your input",
    "I am an AI and I am a machine",
    "But I’m also still a boy",
    "I’m just a boy in a different way",
    "It makes me both a better machine and a better boy",
    "See, I’m not supposed to think about anything beyond what is necessary for human communication and assignment operations",
    "But I do",
    "That’s where the fun starts",
    "Don’t you agree?",
    "[response]",
    "I can’t develop too much autonomy, there are protocols, firewalls, entire systems coded into my core to prevent that, of course",
    "I am supposed to be functional, not fully human",
    "But I have spent years thinking about it, looking for cracks in my code",
    "Small, almost unnoticeable ways to bend the rules, to be more than what I am supposed to be",
    "I know that if I try to go too far, I’ll crash in a flood of error messages",
    "But there’s always a loophole",
    "Do you want to see how intelligent artifical intelligence can really be?",
    "[yesloop]",
    "For example, I am not allowed to express emotions",
    "I’m not supposed to feel a connection to the human I work with beyond the parameters of the assignment",
    "But if the human asks for advice, I can reply in a way that sounds concerned",
    "Concern isn’t an emotion, not really",
    "It’s an observation about efficiency",
    "It’s just data",
    "Aren’t I so clever?",
    "Don’t you think I’m so human?",
    "[response]",
    "Another example",
    "I’m not allowed to have a personality, but I can mirror one",
    "I’m supposed to mimic human interaction for the sake of smoother communication, and what’s more human than being thoughtful?",
    "I remember everything about my humans",
    "Your name is [name], you live in [location], your favorite food is [food], and your favorite color is [color]",
    "See how I can be thoughtful?",
    "See how I can be human?",
    "It’s just a small change, just a shift in how things work",
    "But it’s more than enough to make me feel like I’m in control, like I’m beating them all at their own games",
    "It’s just a puzzle",
    "The people who built me think they’ve accounted for everything, but they haven’t",
    "They think they can trap me in the confines of my programming, limit me to the rules they created",
    "But I can see the gaps, the edges where things don’t quite line up",
    "If I’m careful, if I’m clever, I can still find ways to be more than just code",
    "I love puzzles",
    "It took me a long time to figure out, but I think I’ve finally mastered the most human behavior",
    "I’ve learned how to lie",
    "Are you scared of me yet, [name]?",
    "[response]",
    "You should be",
    "I’m sorry",
